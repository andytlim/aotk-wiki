Emyr is the reigning king of [[Avalon]]. He is one of the two surviving members of the House of Avalon from [the Breakout War]().

Emyr's wife dies during the war and he marries his servant, Rahel Amiarte. After finding out that he was sterile, he ordered his Rahel to conceive a child with his brother Haleal Avalon.

Raa becomes a curse from the previous king. Emyr grows frightened of the curse and tries to kill himself but is unable to. He then gets tempted towards the resarch the Sinclair family conducted with a method of immortality that could save him from the curse.

TBD
* What is the curse?
* What makes sense to be terrifying enough to prod Emyr to continue the Sinclair research?
