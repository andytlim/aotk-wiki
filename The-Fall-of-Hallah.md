The **Fall of Hallah** is a Avalonian tale that pertains to the a point in history where the world was originally and universally named [[Hallah]] (not to be confused with [[New Hallah]]). It is said that good and evil did not exist in Hallah. There were only Dew's rules. During this time period, there were no [[Royal House]]s and everyone lived in harmony with [[Dew]]. 

## Dew's Rules
* Man and woman will be paired according to Dew's will
* Man and woman may only be fruitful on the Day of Shamah

## The Fruit That Chose Love
At the birth of the 6th generation of children, Dew took one of the newborn babies and announced to the world, "Behold, this child's name will be Lilith and Love shall be in this world." Dew raised Lilith until the coming of age. On the 10th Day of Shamah, Dew brough Lilith to Lake of Shamah and spoke to her, "Love cannot exist without. To be become Love, you will also be without. What Love you become will abide in me forever. What without you gain can never abide in me. I ask, do you will Love?" Lilith replied "I know not Love, but I will what you ask. I will without, in the hope to abide in you." Dew then bathed Lilith in the Lake of Shamah and established a pact with her, which was [[the Great Drop]] and the people of Hallah knew Love and were merry. Lilith then fell in love with Dew.   stole Dew's [[Great Drop]] out of contempt after he rejected her because of his duty for his people. She  convinced a substantial number of people of Hallah to usurp Dew in power. Her attempt was futile and the Great Drop was shattered into [10 pieces](/wiki/Tears) during her encounter with Dew. Dew was angered greatly and cursed Lilith and exiled her from Hallah. Dew then hid himself from the world.

## Royal Houses
After many years passed, the outcome of the division of the people of Hallah led to the beginning of Royal Houses.
