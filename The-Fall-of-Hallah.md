The **Fall of Hallah** is a Avalonian tale that pertains to the a point in history where the world was originally named [[Hallah]] (not to be confused with [[New Hallah]]). [[Dew]] created mavis, which gave life to the Hallah and humans were brought into existence. He spent his days in Hallah with his people. Good and evil did not exist during Dew's rule because good did not exist. During this time period, there were no [[Royal House]]s and everyone lived in harmony with Dew. 

After several generations had passed, Dew wanted to bring Love into existence. And on the birth of the 6th generation of children, Dew took one of the newborn babies and named her Lilith, who he had planned to give the gift of Love to.  

Dew raised Lilith as his daughter until the coming of age. He taught her many things about the world he created and finally on the 10th [[Day of Shamac]], Dew asked her if she wanted the gift of Love and warned her about the shortcomings it would entail. Even so, Lilith accepted whole-heartedly.

Dew then bathed Lilith in the [[Lake of Shamac]] and established a pact with her, which was [[the Great Drop]] and Lilith became awakened and knew what Love was. Dew then forewarn

the people of Hallah knew Love and were merry. Lilith then fell in love with Dew. And Dew accepted Lilith as his pair. On the 13th Day of Shamah, Lilith was overcome by a strong emotion which soon became known as lust. The emotion overwhelemed her and she paired with a man in secret. Upon the discovery, Dew became greatly upset. And then he became angry. And then wrath pursued. Dew destroyed the pact and the Great Drop was shattered into [13 pieces](/wiki/Tears). Dew then cursed and exiled Lilith from Hallah and told the people of Hallah "Let him who truly know without become king of this world." Dew then hid himself from the world.

After many years passed, the outcome of the division of the people of Hallah led to the beginning of Royal Houses.
