The **Fall of Hallah** is a Avalonian tale that pertains to the a point in history where the world was originally named [[Hallah]] (not to be confused with [[New Hallah]]). [[Dew]] created mavis, which gave life to the Hallah and humans were brought into existence. He spent his days in Hallah with his people. Good and evil did not exist during Dew's rule because good did not exist. During this time period, there were no [[Royal House]]s and everyone lived in harmony with Dew. 

After several generations had passed, Dew wanted to bring Love into existence. And on the birth of the 6th generation of children, Dew took one of the newborn babies and named her Lilith, who he had planned to give the gift of Love to.  

Dew raised Lilith as his daughter until the coming of age. He taught her many things about the world he created and finally on the 10th [[Day of Shamac]], Dew asked her if she wanted the gift of Love and the wonders it would bring. He also warned her about the shortcomings it may entail. Even so, Lilith accepted whole-heartedly.

Dew then bathed Lilith in the [[Lake of Shamac]] and established a pact with her, which was [[the Great Drop]] and Lilith became awakened and knew what Love was. Dew then told her to go and teach the people Love.

The moment the pact was made, all the people of Hallah experienced the beginning emotions of Love. And Lilith taught them. 

Lilith became the embodiment of Love, and she could feel everyone's emotions. But the people of Hallah began to feel other emotions that were brought into this world because of Love and it began to taint Lilith. Lilith became overwhelmed with corrupt emotions, forcing Dew to destroy the pact in order to save Lilith. The Great Drop was shattered into [13 pieces](/wiki/Tears) as a result. Even after the link was severed, the corruption did not leave Lilith. Dew then exiled Lilith from Hallah and hid himself from the world.

## Royal Houses
After many years passed, the outcome of the division of the people of Hallah led to the beginning of Royal Houses.
