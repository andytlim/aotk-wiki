The **Fall of Hallah** is a legendary tale that pertains to the a point in history where the world was originally and universally named [[Hallah]] (not to be confused with [[New Hallah]]). During this time period, there were no [[Royal House]]s and everyone lived in harmony with [[Dew]]. 

## The Unfortunate Fruit
In Avalonian legend, it is said that good and evil did not exist in Hallah. There were only [[Dew's rules]]. a woman named Lilith fell in love with [[Dew]].  stole Dew's [[Great Drop]] out of contempt after he rejected her because of his duty for his people. She  convinced a substantial number of people of Hallah to usurp Dew in power. Her attempt was futile and the Great Drop was shattered into [10 pieces](/wiki/Tears) during her encounter with Dew. Dew was angered greatly and cursed Lilith and exiled her from Hallah. Dew then hid himself from the world.

## Royal Houses
After many years passed, the outcome of the division of the people of Hallah led to the beginning of Royal Houses.
