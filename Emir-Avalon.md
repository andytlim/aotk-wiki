Emir is the reigning king of [[Avalon]]. He is one of the two surviving members of the House of Avalon from [the Breakout War]().

Emir's wife dies during the war and Emir marries his servant, Rahel Amiarte. After finding out that he was sterile, he ordered his Rahel to conceive a child with his brother Haleal Avalon.

Raa becomes a curse from the previous king. Emir grows frightened of the curse and tries to kill himself but is unable to. He then gets tempted towards the resarch the Sinclair family conducted with a method of immortality that could save him from the curse.
